For this exercise, please try to reproduce the results from Experiment 1 of the associated paper (Ko, Sadler & Galinsky, 2015). The PDF of the paper is included in the same folder as this Rmd file. 

#### Methods summary: 

A sense of power has often been tied to how we perceive each other's voice. Social hierarchy is embedded into the structure of society and provides a metric by which others relate to one another. In 1956, the Brunswik Lens Model was introduced to examine how vocal cues might influence hierarchy. In "The Sound of Power: Conveying and Detecting Hierarchical Rank Through Voice," Ko and colleagues investigated how manipulation of hierarchical rank within a situation might impact vocal acoustic cues. Using the Brunswik Model, six acoustic metrics were utilized (pitch mean & variability, loudness mean & variability, and resonance mean & variability) to isolate a potential contribution between individuals of different hierarchal rank. In the first experiment, Ko, Sadler & Galinsky examined the vocal acoustic cues of individuals before and after being assigned a hierarchical rank in a sample of 161 subjects (80 male). Each of the six hierarchy acoustic cues were analyzed with a 2 (high vs. low rank condition) x 2 (male vs. female) analysis of covariance, controlling for the baseline of the respective acoustic cue.

#### Target outcomes: 

Below is the specific result you will attempt to reproduce (quoted directly from the results section of Experiment 1):

> The impact of hierarchical rank on speakers’ acoustic cues. Each of the six hierarchy-based (i.e., postmanipulation) acoustic variables was submitted to a 2 (condition: high rank, low rank) × 2 (speaker’s sex: female, male) between-subjects analysis of covariance, controlling for the corresponding baseline acoustic variable. Table 4 presents the adjusted means by condition. Condition had a significant effect on pitch, pitch variability, and loudness variability. Speakers’ voices in the high-rank condition had higher pitch, **F(1, 156) = 4.48, p < .05**; were more variable in loudness, **F(1, 156) = 4.66, p < .05**; and were more monotone (i.e., less variable in pitch), **F(1, 156) = 4.73, p < .05**, compared with speakers’ voices in the low-rank condition (**all other Fs < 1**; see the Supplemental Material for additional analyses of covariance involving pitch and loudness). (from Ko et al., 2015, p. 6; emphasis added)

The adjusted means for these analyses are reported in Table 4 (Table4_AdjustedMeans.png, included in the same folder as this Rmd file).

## Step 1: Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(car) # for ANCOVA
library(effectsize) # for calculating effect size
library(emmeans) # for estimating marginal means
```

## Step 2: Load data

```{r}
# Just Experiment 1
d <- read_csv("data/S1_voice_level_Final.csv")

## render data in markdown
DT::datatable(d)
```

## Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
## confirm participant counts reported in paper
nrow(d) == 161
nrow(subset(d, sex == "M")) == 80 ## male
nrow(subset(d, sex == "F")) == 81 ## female

## key variables from codebook:
### voice = voice identification number
### plev = hierarchy rank (+1 = high, -1 = low)
### vsex = speaker sex (+1 = female, -1 = male)
### ‘_s’ = script, acoustics recorded while saying negotiation script
### ‘_r’ = rainbow, acoustics recorded during rainbow passage
### ‘mean’ = average value of acoustic during a clip
### ‘var’ = variance for acoustic during a clip
### pitch = "pitch_..."
### loudness = "intense_..."
### resonance = "form_..."

### sort data by high/low-rank
d_high <- filter(d, plev == 1)
d_low <- filter(d, plev == -1)

## grab relevant columns
d_subset <- d |>
  select(voice, plev, vsex,

### Inferential statistics

> The impact of hierarchical rank on speakers’ acoustic cues. Each of the six hierarchy-based (i.e., postmanipulation) acoustic variables was submitted to a 2 (condition: high rank, low rank) × 2 (speaker’s sex: female, male) between-subjects analysis of covariance, controlling for the corresponding baseline acoustic variable. [...] Condition had a significant effect on pitch, pitch variability, and loudness variability. Speakers’ voices in the high-rank condition had higher pitch, **F(1, 156) = 4.48, p < .05**; were more variable in loudness, **F(1, 156) = 4.66, p < .05**; and were more monotone (i.e., less variable in pitch), **F(1, 156) = 4.73, p < .05**, compared with speakers’ voices in the low-rank condition (**all other Fs < 1**; see the Supplemental Material for additional analyses of covariance involving pitch and loudness).

## Step 5: Reflection

**Were you able to reproduce the results you attempted to reproduce? If not, what part(s) were you unable to reproduce?**

Yes, I was able to successfully reproduce all of the results of this paper in their entirety.

**How difficult was it to reproduce your results?**

Not very difficult; the only challenging component was figuring out which columns in the original dataset corresponded with the correct constructs being reported in the paper/the original figure. I also had to ensure that I knew which variables were the baseline and which weren't to properly setup the models.

**What aspects made it difficult? What aspects made it easy?**

One of the most annoying issues I found was that in the original paper (Table 4), the authors reported eta-squared as the header for the table; however, the actual values that were computed were partial eta-squared effect sizes, which I caught when noticing initially that the numbers were off when I first computed full eta-squared effect sizes as I would have expected based on the header used in the table. Nonetheless, calculating partial eta-squared effect sizes resulted in the correct results reported in Table 4.
